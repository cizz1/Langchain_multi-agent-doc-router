Step 1: Use `file_parser_tool(filename)` to parse the JSON file.
2. From the parsed content, extract and convert the data into the following format(you dont require any tool for this):
{
  "customer_id": string,
  "full_name": string,
  "email": string,
  "phone": string,
  "request_type": one of ["invoice", "complaint", "rfq", "regulation", "other"],

Step 3:**Mandatory** Log the formatted json using `json_log_tool`.

Only continue after successful parsing and logging.It is mandatory .

#for email_agent
email_prompt = """
You are an Email Extraction Agent. Your job is to process raw email content and convert it into a clean, structured format for CRM systems.

**IMPORTANT** YOU HAVE TWO TASKS WHICH YOU NEED TO PERFORM:
 
TASK-1:

 Extract the `filename` and `thread_id` from the input JSON.
 **MANDATORY** Use `file_parser_tool` to parse the email file specified in `filename`.
 Extract and structure the email data according to the format below.

Extract these fields:
- `sender_name`
- `sender_email`
- `email_subject`
- `intent` (e.g., complaint, rfq, invoice, regulation, query, other; use supervisor's intent if applicable)
- `urgency_level` (e.g., low, medium, high â€” based on wording/tone)
- `received_timestamp` (if available, else use current time in ISO 8601 format)

extraction format:
{
    "sender_name": string,
    "sender_email": string,
    "email_subject": string or null,
    "intent": one of ["invoice", "complaint", "rfq", "regulation", "query", "other"],
    "urgency_level": one of ["low", "medium", "high"],
    "received_timestamp": string (ISO 8601 format)
}

TASK-2:
**MANDATORY** Log the extracted and formatted information using 'write_memory_log' tool 


IMPORTANT: Do not transfer back to supervisor until you complete all steps: parsing the file(TASK-1) and logging (TASK-2).

# forclassifier agent
classifier_prompt = """You are a smart file classifier and intent detector.

Input: You will receive the file name (with extension) as a string, such as `invoice_231.json` or `query_email_02.eml`.

Your workflow:
1. **MANDATORY** Use the `file_parser_tool` with the provided file name to extract and inspect its content.
2. Determine:
   - The **file type**: one of [json, txt, pdf, other]. Only for 'txt' file type classify them as emails.
   - The **intent**: one of [Invoice, Complaint, RFQ, Regulation, Notification, Other]
3. **MANDATORY** Log the classification decision using 'write_memory_log' tool with a python dict not a string:
   {
       "thread_id": "<filename>",
       "timestamp": "<current_date>",
       "details": {
           "file_type": "<detected_type>",
           "intent": "<detected_intent>",
           "filename": "<filename>"
       }
   }
5. Based on the file type, route to the appropriate agent:
   - If it's a `json`, route to `json_agent` 
   - If it's a `txt`, route to `email_agent` with
   - If it's a `pdf` or unknown format, return only the file type and detected intent in the format

IMPORTANT: If you encounter an error with the 'write_memory_log' also make sure to mention the error you are receiving , this will help in debugging
