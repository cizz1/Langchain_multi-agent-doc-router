Subject: Product malfunction - urgent assistance required

Hello,

I recently purchased a batch of Model ZX500 voltage regulators from your company (Order ID: 788120-B). After just two weeks, three out of five units have failed during testing. This has impacted our production schedule severely.

Please advise on next steps for a replacement or refund.

Sincerely,
Dheeraj Kapoor
